>    1. This bot is not beautiful. I wrote it quick and dirty and do not care about code conventions or other shit... I will never care about those things.

>   2. The code is not complete so far. Some parts like urls contains non-www/www site is not filtered. 
>
>   3. If you want to use this code, feel free to do so. Keep in mind you have to customize things to make it run on your system.

>   4. I know that I have some false positives and I know that I miss some credentials. So if you think this is crap...ok. leave now. If you have ideas for a better detection, just let me know!

>   5. And again: QUICK AND DIRTY! Do not expect nice code.
